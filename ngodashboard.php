		<h1> NGO's: They see the need, not the cause.</h1><br>
		<p style="font-size:22px">
		Globalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of NGOs. 
Many problems could not be solved within a nation. 
International treaties and international organizations such as the World Trade Organization 
were centred mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. 
In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize humanitarian issues, 
developmental aid and sustainable development. 
NGOs include groups and institutions that are entirely or
largely independent of government and that have primarily
humanitarian or cooperative rather than commercial objectives.
They are private agencies in industrial countries that support
international development; indeginous groups organized
regionally or nationally; and member-groups in villages.
