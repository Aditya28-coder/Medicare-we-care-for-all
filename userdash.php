				<h1>Need Of Donations</h1><br>
			<p style="font-size:25px"> Providing access to medicines and health care is one of the most challenging issues the society is facing today. There are poor and needy persons who are not able to buy expensive medicines and the poor persons at old age homes who are dependent on your charity. It's a request to help in donating the medicines that are unused and also Nevertheless, we never found an issue with that because there are nice people who make a charity of medicines i.e. people like you donate, still the needs aren’t met. We try our best to help them. We request everyone to make as much as donations for medicines so that the world for the golden ager and poor people can be a better place. Click on Donate Medicines for donation and Thank you always for making donations.
